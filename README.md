**Bot-tiquette**
*A crowdsourced etiquette for reddit bots.*  

---

- **Blacklist certain subreddits unless requested by the subreddit's moderators**  
  Bots do not belong on some subreddits, especially those which encourage serious
  discussion, such as
    [/r/suicidewatch](http://reddit.com/r/suicidewatch) and
    [/r/depression](http://reddit.com/r/depression).
  Before adding a bot to a subreddit, read the sidebar or the wiki to make sure
  bots are allowed in the subreddit.
  **Suggestion**: *It might be better for a bot to listen on certain selected
  subreddits rather than all subreddits except blacklisted ones. This makes it
  easier for you to remove the subreddits that you are banned from and eliminate
  wasted searches.*

- **Limit the number of replies per submission**  
  A bot is meant to enchance the flow of a conversation. To make sure your bot
  doesn't saturate the thread with replies, keep a reasonable cap on the number
  of replies per submission.  
  **Suggestion**: *Usually, this should be around 5-10 replies depending on the
  size of the subreddit.*

- **Do not have the bot reply to every instance of a common word/phrase**  
  This would not only cause a great amount of "stress" on the bot, it would also
  derail conversations by appearing too frequently in threads. What constitutes
  a common word or phrase is up to the creator.  
  **Suggestion**: *There are many ways to limit the appearance of a bot. You can 
  use a narrower regular expression or only reply to comments with a lot of
  upvotes. __Consider making a bot appear only when specifically called.__*

- **Do not run a duplicate bot**
  Before releasing your bot, make sure there are no other bots that serve a
  similar purpose to yours. If you are forking a person's code from pastebin or
  github, make sure the original bot is no longer functioning.

---
- **Some bots that should not be created:**
  These popular types of bots are a blatant violation of the bottiquette above and
  should never be created under any circumstances.
  - Bots that correct spelling or grammar.
  - Bots that restore a deleted comment or post.

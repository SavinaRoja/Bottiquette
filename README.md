**Bot-tiquette**
*A crowdsourced etiquette for reddit bots.*  

---

- **Blacklist certain subreddits unless requested by the subreddit's moderators**  
  Bots do not belong on some subreddits, especially those which encourage serious
  discussion, such as
    [/r/suicidewatch](http://reddit.com/r/suicidewatch) and
    [/r/depression](http://reddit.com/r/depression).
  Before adding a bot to a subreddit, read the sidebar or the wiki to make sure
  bots are allowed in the subreddit.
  *Suggestion*: *It might be better for a bot to listen on certain selected
  subreddits rather than all subreddits except blacklisted ones. This makes it
  easier for you to remove the subreddits that you are banned from and eliminate
  wasted searches.*
